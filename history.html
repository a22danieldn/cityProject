    <h1>Legend & mythology: Creation of the world</h1>
        <p>The most interesting Korean myth to learn would be the creation of the world. A topic that all of us have thought about at some point in our lives.
        <br><br>
        The creation myth or the founding myth states that the people on Earth didn't even exist at the start. "Yul-Ryeo," a divinity, and "Mago," a goddess, arose. Yul-Ryeo then passed away. 
        <br><br>
        Gung-hee and So-hee are two deities that were born from Mago. They gave birth to two angelic men and two angelic women. Yul-Ryeo is resurrected just after the arrival of the <strong>Celestial People</strong>, and by her rebirth, the paradise and the Earth were formed, along with water, fire, and the "ki" (soul). Those components eventually created herbs, birds, plants, and animals. 
        <br><br>
        The Celestial People governed all living creatures from their celestial castle, called 'Magoseong,' in honor of the deity. Mago opted to remain with Yul-Ryeo, whose entire body has become the Earth.</p>
