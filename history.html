      <p><strong>Seoul</strong>, officially known as the <strong>Seoul Special City</strong>, is the capital and largest
        metropolis of South Korea. According to the 2020 census, Seoul has a population of 9.9 million people, and forms
        the heart of the Seoul Capital Area with the surrounding Incheon metropolis and Gyeonggi province. Considered to
        be a global city and rated as an Alpha - City by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC), Seoul
        was the world's 4th largest metropolitan economy in 2014 after Tokyo, New York City and Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Seoul was rated Asia's most livable city with the second highest quality of life globally by <em>Arcadis</em>
        in 2015, with a <em>GDP per capita (PPP)</em> of around $40,000. With major technology hubs centered in
        <em>Gangnam</em> and <em>Digital Media City</em>, the Seoul Capital Area is home to the headquarters of 15
        <em>Fortune Global 500</em> companies, including <em>Samsung</em>, <em>LG</em>, and <em>Hyundai</em>. Ranked
        seventh in the <em>Global Power City Index</em> and <em>Global Financial Centres Index</em>, the metropolis

        Seoul has hosted the <em>1986 Asian Games</em>, <em>1988 Summer Olympics</em>, and the <em>2010 G20 Seoul
          summit</em>.</p>
      <p>Seoul was the capital of various Korean states, including <em>Baekje</em>, <em>Joseon</em>, the <em>Korean
          Empire</em>, <em>Goryeo</em> (as a secondary capital), and presently South Korea. It is strategically located
        along the <em>Han River</em>. Seoul's history stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18
        BC by the people of <em>Baekje</em>, one of the <em>Three Kingdoms of Korea</em>. The city was later designated
        the capital of <em>Korea</em> under the Joseon dynasty. Seoul is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly
        landscape, with <em>Bukhan Mountain</em> located on the northern edge of the city. The <em>Seoul Capital</em>
        Area contains five UNESCO <em>World Heritage Sites</em> <em>Changdeok Palace</em>, <em>Hwaseong Fortress</em>,
        <em>Jongmyo Shrine</em>, <em>Namhansanseong</em> and the <em>Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty</em>. More
        recently, Seoul has been a major site of modern architectural construction – major modern landmarks include the
        N Seoul Tower, the <em>63 Building</em>, the <em>Lotte World Tower</em>, the <em>Dongdaemun Design Plaza</em>,
        <em>Lotte World</em>, <em>Trade Tower</em>, <em>COEX</em>, and the <em>IFC Seoul</em>. Seoul was named the
        <em>2010 World Design Capital</em>. It is the birthplace of <em>K-pop</em> and the <em>Korean wave</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Korean mythology</strong> (<em>Korean:</em> 한국 신화; <em>Hanja:</em> 韓國神話 Han'guk sinhwa) is the group of
        <em>myths</em> told by historical and modern <em>Koreans</em>. There are two types: the written, literary
        mythology in traditional histories, mostly about the founding monarchs of <em>various historical kingdoms</em>,
        and the much larger and more diverse oral mythology, mostly narratives sung by <em>shamans</em> or priestesses
        (mansin) in <em>rituals invoking the gods</em> and which are still considered sacred today.</p>

      <h2>Creation of the world</h2>
      <h6>From Samaha Kazmi, <a href="https://ling-app.com/author/samaha-kazmi/">Blog</a> - Last Updated: Abr 21, 2022 -

      <p>Korean supernatural stories, unsurprisingly, have such a way of capturing our interest with their unusual
        themes. This is because the screenwriters have access to various Korean mythology and urban tales. There are no
        boundaries for letting their minds run unchecked, from god-like "dokkaebi" (도깨비- Goblin) to angry ghosts.</p>
      <p>The most interesting Korean myth to learn would be the creation of the world. A topic that all of us have
        thought about at some point in our lives.</p>
      <p>The creation myth or the founding myth states that the people on Earth didn't even exist at the start.
        "Yul-Ryeo," a divinity, and "Mago," a goddess, arose. Yul-Ryeo then passed away.</p>
      <p>Gung-hee and So-hee are two deities that were born from Mago. They gave birth to two angelic men and two
        angelic women. Yul-Ryeo is resurrected just after the arrival of the <strong>Celestial People</strong>, and by
        her rebirth, the paradise and the Earth were formed, along with water, fire, and the "ki" (soul). Those
        components eventually created herbs, birds, plants, and animals.</p>
      <p>The Celestial People governed all living creatures from their celestial castle, called 'Magoseong,' in honor of
        the deity. Mago opted to remain with Yul-Ryeo, whose entire body has become the Earth.</p>
