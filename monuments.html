        <h1>Monuments of the city</h1>
        <p>One of the best things about South Korea is it’s a land filled with a rich cultural heritage. While these cultural gems form the heart of a list of <strong>famous landmarks in South Korea</strong>, in recent years, the country has seen a simultaneous cultural emergence and tremendous growth in its technological industries. Famed the world over for the influence of K-Pop, Korean skincare and beauty, South Korea is becoming more and more influential over the west.
        <br><br>As we discussed Seoul, these are some of its most important monuments:</p>

        <h2>Gyeongbokgung</h2>
        <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - Last Updated: Sept 28, 2022 - <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung">Source of information</a></em><br></h6>

        <p><strong>Gyeongbokgung</strong> (<em>Korean:</em> 경복궁; <em>Hanja:</em> 景福宮), also known as <strong>Gyeongbokgung Palace</strong> or <strong>Gyeongbok Palace</strong>, was the main royal <em>palace</em> of the <em>Joseon dynasty</em>. Built in 1395, it is located in northern Seoul, <em>South Korea</em>. The largest of the <em>Five Grand Palaces</em> built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon.<br>
            <br>Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the <em>Imjin War</em> (1592-1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of <em>Prince Regent Heungseon</em> during the reign of <em>King Gojong</em>. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares. The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.<br>
            <br>In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by <em>Imperial Japan</em>. On January 21, 1963, it was designated as a cultural property. Since the 1990s, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. Today, the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the <em>National Palace Museum</em> and the <em>National Folk Museum</em> within the premises of the complex.</p>
