      <p><strong>Korean place name etymologies</strong> are based upon a large linguistic background of
        <em>Chinese</em>, <em>Japanese</em> and <em>Old Korean</em> influence and history. The commonplace names have
        multiple meanings in Korean, Chinese, and when transliterated to <em>English</em> as well. The etymological
        meanings of these words stem from history, mythology and the landscape of the area. The place names appear with
        commonality within the <em>Korean Peninsula</em> and therefore attain a level of interest as to why they appear
        so frequently. Place names are not the country or province but the local area, and usually contain reference to
        the land it is named for; whether by historical fact or the landscape it is set in. Name elements such as
        <em>cheon</em>, <em>san</em>, <em>seong</em>, and <em>ju</em> appear often as markers of location or history.
        Over time, these markers can lose their original meaning, yet they remain as indicators of a historical
        etymology. Korean place names can contain characters that are Chinese and thus can be transliterated into
        Chinese with reference to Chinese words. Korean can also follow the similar <em>grammatical structure</em> as
        Japanese, however whether there is a relationship between the two languages is still unknown as of yet.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p><em>Korean history</em> is connected to the Korean language, as from early Korean myths and legends they
        receive many of their common place names. The old Korean language is divided by three distinct types of the
        language - the <em>Koguryó</em>, <em>Paekche</em>, and <em>Silla</em> kingdoms. It is from the Silla defeat of
        the other two kingdoms that Korea came to have to its modern-day geographical boundaries, including from the
        <em>Koryo Dynasty</em> from which the western name for Korea is derived. The Korean language is considered to be
        structurally closest to Japanese, yet debate amongst linguists still continues as to how the languages are
        connected. In writing Korea took much from the Chinese with their characters being called <em>Hanja</em> (한자)
        (in Chinese it is called <em>Hanzi</em> (漢字)) based on the Chinese characters borrowed and added to the Korean
        language. Some Chinese words can also influence the etymology of Korean place names. A main feature of Korean is
        <em>Hangul</em>, which is a syllabic writing system. The "clustering of letters" into syllables had been created
        as a way of bringing writing to the common people, and to contrast the Chinese characters that were used by the
        literary elite.</p>

      <h2>Etylology</h2>
      <p>The etymology of Korean words, especially common place names, can have origins in the Chinese language as
        Korean has taken many of their characters into their own language. Many of Korean place names have roots in
        Chinese characters, which is evident in their similarities when translated. The etymology of a word is tied to
        its historical growth, which allows for changes. Many of common Korean place names contain words such as
        <em>seong</em> (성) (“city” [as in “fortress”]) which reference that certain townships must have been built
        inside fortresses, or fortifications, and therefore historically have changed since then. History influences
        many of the common names seen today, such as the city of <em>Gyeongju</em> (경주), which has ties to the Silla
        kingdom. It was the capital of the kingdom, where it was known as <em>Seorabeol</em> (“capital”), and also
        <em>Geumseong</em> (“city of gold”). The city was renamed to Gyeongju in 940 by <em>King Taejo</em>, due to its
        prosperity and fame. It can be translated as “congratulatory city” or “capital city”. <em>Busan</em> also has a
        historic background to its etymology, as it is <em>Sino-Korean</em> for “cauldron mountain” (부산). The first
        written recording of Busan was in 1402 as “Dongnae-Busanpo”, and was recorded as “Busanpo” for the latter half
        of the 15th century. It is believed to be named for Mt. Hwangryeong (황령산), and reflects the geographical changes
        of the city during the end of the 15th century.</p>
