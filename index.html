    <h2>About this site:</h2>
        <p>You may be wondering why this HTML exists, the answer is that it is one small piece (of many) of markup language work from my higher education degree.</p>
        <p>Why I chose Seoul? Well, I personally had an interesting history with this country during 2005 and 2006 that occupied part of my work at that time (related to music, culture and videogame competition). This has led me to remember and use this city in the exercise.</p>
