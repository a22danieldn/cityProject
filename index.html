      <h2>A message from the creator</h2>
      <p>A few years ago I had the opportunity to visit Seoul twice, I had always wanted to travel to Asia (Japan specifically) but the destiny of life, work and that moment took us to South Korea. This content is a little snippet of some of the things I saw, some of the things I would have liked to see, some history and a little bit of the cultural news.</p>
