      <h1>Notable people</h1>
      <p>South Korea has made a big name for itself in the world, around 2005 it was hardly known to be happening there.
        Nowadays, it is rare that in any country in the world, to generalise a little, you don't know any musical
        artists, actors/actresses or relevant people of the present day.</p>
      <p>Film directors who have won Oscars, TV series that have made an impact on us, artists who have conquered the
        globe and a musical genre (K-Pop) that is already part of our culture and fashion.</p>

      <p><strong>Yoon Suk-yeol</strong> (<em>Korean:</em> 윤석열; born 18 December 1960) is a South Korean politician,

        2022. Prior to his presidency, he served as <em>Prosecutor General of South Korea</em> between 2019 and 2021.
      </p>
      <p>Born in Seoul, Yoon attended <em>Seoul National University</em>. In his capacity as the chief of the Seoul
        Central District Prosecutor's Office, he played a key role in <em>convicting</em> former presidents <em>Park

          South Korea</em> between 2019 and 2021, in which office he secured the conviction of <em>Cho Kuk</em>, an

      <p><strong>Jeong Hyeon-cheol</strong> (<em>Korean:</em> 정현철; born February 21, 1972), better known as <strong>Seo
          Taiji</strong> or <strong>Seo Tae-ji</strong> (서태지), is a South Korean singer, musician, songwriter and record
        producer. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, he rose to become one of the most
        prominent and influential cultural icons in South Korea, with many referring to him as "the President of
        Culture".</p>
      <p>Following a brief stint in the <em>heavy metal</em> band <em>Sinawe</em>, Taiji formed <em>Seo Taiji and
          Boys</em> in 1992 with whom he found immediate success. Their style of music, dance, fashion, and
        self-presentation resonated with the young generation—termed the sinsedae, "new generation." They incorporated
        elements of popular musical genres from the West and contributed considerably larger to Korean <em>pop
          culture</em> and <em>Korean pop's</em> development in the 1990s. His songs addressed social and political
        concerns of the youth including the stressful and stifling system of education in Korea, and the rage of youth
        in the face of poor social and economic outlook. Widespread youth backlash to government suppression of the
        social commentary in his music became a catalyst for the abolishment of censorship of Korean popular music
        lyrics. His career paved the way for free expression in Korean pop music. Although he initially announced
        retirement upon disbanding the group in 1996, Taiji released his first solo album two years later and continued
        his successful career.</p>
